<h3 class="h2 font-weight-light mb-3">When To Visit Saint Petersburg</h3>
<p>June to August is the best time to go as the temperature is perfect for outdoor activities hovering around 20 - 25&deg;C and you are more likely to get a clear day than shoulder seasons. Clear days are hard to come by out of the summertime so I would only recommend this period.</p>

<h3 class="h2 font-weight-light mb-3">How To Get Around Saint Petersburg</h3>
<p>Saint Petersburg attractions are mostly concentrated around the winter palace area so most of the places are walkable.</p>
<p>If you want to explore a little further, the metro system is possibly the cheapest and fastest way to get around inside the city. It should cost you around 45 RUB (0.8 USD) per single trip of any distance.</p>
<p>Buses are a little bit cheaper (40 RUB) but depend on the traffic and time, it might be faster and more reliable to stick with the metro.</p>
<p>Getting from the airport and vice versa are relatively easy and cheap. When you exit the terminal, there will be a bus waiting going to the city. Hop on and pay 40 RUB (luggage not included) and it will take you to "Moskovskaya" metro station and from there you can take the metro to where you are staying.</p>

<h3 class="h2 font-weight-light mb-3">Where To Stay In Saint Petersburg</h3>
<p>Saint Petersburg -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/hostel-chickadee.en-gb.html?aid=905356" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hostel Chickadee</a>&nbsp;- 6.5 USD/Night (Centrally located inside an old European building with beautiful wooden decors and comfortable beds with curtains.)</p>
<p>If you booked the same hostel that I do, from Moskovskaya station, get on the dark blue line and change to red line at Tekhnologicheskiy Institut station and head to Vladimirskaya station and you are 2 blocks away from Hostel Chickadee.</p>
<p>This place is moderately priced with transportation, food and accommodation average around&nbsp;<strong>35 - 55 USD per day</strong>&nbsp;per person. Not that cheap but not too expensive.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is just a suggested daily budget based on my style of traveling, which is leaning more toward the budget side of things. If you want to stick to this budget, expect to sleep in dorms, eat out only a few times, and be comfortable using the cheapest and most convenient way of transportation, which often times involves walking.</p>
