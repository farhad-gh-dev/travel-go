title: "3 Months Itinerary For Europe"
description: "Like most of us in the world, we can only stay in Europe (Schengen Zone) for the maximum time of 3 months (90 days) in a 6 months period and so who wouldn't want to make the best out of their limited time when they are visiting Europe..."

<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">When To Visit Europe</h3>
<p>Europe is extremely crowded where ever you go in the summer so I would recommend visiting from&nbsp;<strong>April to May</strong>&nbsp;(Spring) and&nbsp;<strong>September to October</strong>&nbsp;(Autumn) instead.</p>
<p>During these periods, you will get the best of both worlds, with fewer tourists, cheaper prices for accommodations, good average temperature, and the colors of nature are in full swing. Plus, outdoor activities you can attend in cities like Berlin are still happening during these months so it will be fun nonetheless.</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">How To Get Around Europe</h3>
<p>Europe is massive and since this itinerary covers over 10 countries, a well-planned route and mode of transportation are essential especially with the 90 days limits on our tourist visa. Here are a few ways you can get around Europe:</p>
<p><strong>Low-Cost Airlines</strong>&nbsp;like RyanAir is a great option if you want to shorten your travel time significantly and travel far but it is expensive and with this itinerary, you will likely be traveling close by and making your way slowly around the continent so you won't be flying.</p>
<p><strong>Buses</strong>&nbsp;are one of the best and cheapest ways to travel around Europe. Most of the locations covered in this itinerary can be traveled by bus (except Zermatt where you will have to take the train).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8745201/type/dlg/https://www.busbud.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flixbus</a>&nbsp;is a great option with affordable prices and a good network of buses that connect most of the places I listed here.</p>
<p><strong>European trains</strong>&nbsp;are also a good option if you want to travel fast but it can get expensive real quick so I would recommend to only use it when there is no bus going on the day you want to travel.</p>

<br />

<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Internet In Europe</h3>
<p>Given the new data roaming surcharge ban that went into effect in 2017, we can now have one local sim card bought in the EU and use it in most places in Europe without having to buy a new sim card for every new country you visit making our connected lives so much easier.</p>
<p>In theory, you can buy a sim card from Spain and access data throughout your trip with the same domestic rate no matter where you are, but there are some countries that have yet to comply with the change like Poland and the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Wifi is plenty in these countries so you will have no trouble getting online while on the road, even without roaming sim cards.</p>
<p>One thing to note when you buy a local sim card is that make sure that it actually allows you to go roaming with your data. Go to a proper phone carrier shop, let them activate the roaming data and they should provide you with all the information you might need to stay connected while traveling for 3 months.</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">What To Pack For Europe</h3>
<p>As you know, I am a light traveler and packing light for a trip like this is an art in and of itself. Here are a few tips on what to pack for your trip to Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walking/Hiking Shoes</strong>: I love walking around new cities or go on a small hike and so I highly recommend you take good comfortable shoes with you on this trip. My go-to shoes are the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xixPUy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Timberland Shoes</a>&nbsp;that I wore in most situations, even on long hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Breathable Shirts</strong>: It can be quite hot outside when the sun is out and the sky is clear so be sure to carry with you multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2pkzp41" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">breathable shirts</a>&nbsp;that you can wear when you are out and about.</li>
<li><strong>Outer Shell Jacket</strong>: An outer shell jacket is great for when it is rainy or a little windy outside. I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xpvHK1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Columbia Watertight Jacket</a>. It's breathable, light to carry, and best of all, it comes in this awesome orange color.</li>
<li><strong>Microfiber Towel</strong>: A&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2MFHxVD" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microfiber towel</a>&nbsp;is the perfect backpacker's towel as it is light, easy to dry, and can be compressed to save space in your backpack.</li>

<li><strong>Wool Beanie</strong>: Wool is amazing for cold weather. Cover your ears and warm your head with a&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2pcA5Iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wool beanie</a>&nbsp;when you are out and about.</li>
<li><strong>Wool Gloves</strong>: My hands are always the first to go numb in cold weather and so I always carry&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xqpZrf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wool gloves</a>&nbsp;with me when I'm hiking or when it's cold outside.</li>
<li><strong>Wool Socks</strong>: Also, remember to keep your foot warm with&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2QzDg9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wool socks</a>&nbsp;as well.</li>

<li><strong>Water Bottle</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3ibYqsb" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lifestraw Filter Bottle</a>&nbsp;is a great water bottle to have with you in cities or on hiking trails in case you aren't sure how clean the water source is.</li>
