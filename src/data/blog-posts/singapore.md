<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">What To Pack For Singapore</h3>
<p>As you know, I am a light traveler and packing light for a trip like this is an art in and of itself. Here are a few tips on what to pack for your trip to Singapore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walking/Hiking Shoes</strong>: I love walking around new cities or go on a small hike and so I highly recommend you take good comfortable shoes with you on this trip. My go-to shoes are the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xixPUy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Timberland Shoes</a>&nbsp;that I wore in most situations, even on long hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Breathable Shirts</strong>: It can be quite hot outside when the sun is out and the sky is clear so be sure to carry with you multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2pkzp41" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">breathable shirts</a>&nbsp;that you can wear when you are out and about.</li>
<li><strong>Outer Shell Jacket</strong>: An outer shell jacket is great for when it is rainy or a little windy outside. I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xpvHK1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Columbia Watertight Jacket</a>. It's breathable, light to carry, and best of all, it comes in this awesome orange color.</li>
<li><strong>Microfiber Towel</strong>: A&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2MFHxVD" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microfiber towel</a>&nbsp;is the perfect backpacker's towel as it is light, easy to dry, and can be compressed to save space in your backpack.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming Suits</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3gdyIS6" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Swim trunk</a>&nbsp;is a must-pack item if you are planning to visit Singapore in the summer just in case there is a body of water you can jump in.</li>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: One of the most important items in your backpack will be a good camera to capture the beautiful moments you will be experiencing. I recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2Y8fNlF" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony a6600 camera</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2vrSvvx" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony 16-55mm F2.8 lens</a>. The best high performance and light-weight combination you can get.</li>
<li><strong>Power Bank</strong>: Keep your electronic charged on-the-go with a&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2OvNDJY" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20,000+ mAh Power Bank</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Water Bottle</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3ibYqsb" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lifestraw Filter Bottle</a>&nbsp;is a great water bottle to have with you in cities or on hiking trails in case you aren't sure how clean the water source is.</li>
<li><strong>Universal Adapter</strong>: You just need one&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xsIpHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">universal adapter</a>&nbsp;to plug in your electronics in any country you are visiting.</li>
<li><strong>Packing Cubes</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2NmaCel" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Packing Cubes</a>&nbsp;will help you save space in your backpack as well as keep all your belongings organized.</li>
<li><strong>Daypack</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8745201/type/dlg/https://herschel.com/shop/backpacks/herschel-little-america-backpack?v=10014-00007-OS" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Herschel Supply Little America Backpack</a>&nbsp;is my go-to daypack. It's large enough to carry all my travel gear, it comes in many amazing colors, and it is stylish as hell!</li>
<li><strong>Large Backpack</strong>: You will need a large backpack to carry all of this stuff with you. I recommend you get the&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2QHxliW" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Osprey Atmos AG 65L backpack</a>. With the excellent weight distribution and the lifetime guarantee, you can never go wrong with Osprey.</li>

<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">3 Days Itinerary To Singapore</h3>
<p>I heard that in Singapore, there is a remote island called Pulau Ubin where nature coexisted within the city parameters so my first goal was to see what kind of nature awaits me there. I took a boat out expecting it to be beautiful.&nbsp;Pulau Ubin was once a granite mine which was abandoned and later turned into a popular destination for nature and adventure lovers. I biked around for hours but I couldn't find any photo-worthy outlook point. The whole experience was boring and not as "adventurous" as they claimed.</p>
<p>The whole experience felt like riding a bike in an uninspiring park instead of an island full of nature. The place is good for city dwellers who want a little touch of nature in their lives but not for travelers like us. Nor recommended!</p>

<h4 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Temples, Merlion And Garden By The Bay</h4>
<p>On my second day, I started out in the China town. You can always count on China town when it comes to shopping in Singapore. The price is relatively cheaper than other places. I bought my travel remnant (a Merlion trophy) here as well for SGD7 .There is not much to do in Singapore, but one thing I thoroughly enjoy throughout the trip was food. Delicious food everywhere! Nom nom nom! :D</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went to the Tooth Relic Buddha Temple. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just a very modern temple with great museum-like history display of Buddha. If you are interested in learning about the Buddhist religion,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bucketlistly.blog/posts/4-days-itinerary-madalay-bagan-myanmar">Myanmar</a>&nbsp;is a much better place to be.&nbsp;In the late afternoon, I went to Merlion. This particular place was the place I like least as it was almost impossible to take a great picture of it. Throngs of tourists swarmed this place taking the predictable forced perspective photos with the Merlion.</p>

<h4 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Eat All The Food In The World!</h4>
<p>Since my flight was in the evening, I dedicated today to eating all the food Singapore got to offer. In the morning, I had a kaya toast and a traditional coffee at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yakun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ya Kun Kaya Toast</a>&nbsp;near the Somerset metro station. It was delicious as hell!&nbsp;In the afternoon, I went to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boontongkee.com.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boon Tong Ke</a>&nbsp;restaurant for some tasty Imperial Chicken..</p>
<p>and ended my trip with a bean sprout dish!</p>
<p>There you have it, Singapore through my lens. I hope you enjoyed this guide. If you like cities, shopping, and eating, Singapore is a great stop for a short trip before diving deep into other South East Asian countries.</p>
