<h3 class="h2 font-weight-light mb-3">Day 4 - Taj Mahal!!</h3>
<p>I woke up at 3:30 AM to prepare myself for the once in a lifetime trip, to see the sunrise at the Taj Mahal. My driver was right on time by 5:00 am and we drove for 15 minutes to the ticket booth to buy the entry ticket. Taj Mahal has the most expensive ticket of all the monuments in India. For foreigners, it will cost you around 750 rupees. If you are a citizen of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, your ticket will be cheaper. Since I'm from Thailand which is part of the BIMSTEC countries, I was able to get the ticket for only 510 rupees. You will be distributed with a plastic bag which you will need to cover your shoes as you walk up to the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>After I got the ticket, I was told that no cars were allowed from this point on so I had to take a shared electric bus to the western gate of the Taj Mahal. As I walked to the gate, there was a little line full of foreigners waiting to see the Taj Mahal. I thought there would be more but I guess it was a good idea to travel during the monsoon season.</p>

<p>I heard many people grasped at the beauty of the Taj Mahal as they approached. Hell, I even mumbled "wow" without know it. This place is just freaking beautiful. This place blew all the other monuments I visited and hands down one of the most memorable experience I ever had traveling alone.&nbsp;Pictures are worth more than a thousand words.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal up close. The flowers are carved into the marble, the way they did in the marble factory I visited on my third day in India.&nbsp;The 2 identical red mosques on the sides of the Taj Mahal.&nbsp;The 2 identical red mosques on the sides of the Taj Mahal. Here's the thing about about traveling solo, I can do whatever I want. I just sat on the side enjoying the view of the river and people walking and talking for hours. It was one of the most peaceful moment I had in India. A great break from a busy cities.</p>

<h3 class="h2 font-weight-light mb-3">Day 5 - The Pink City (Jaipur)</h3>
<p>Ram was supposed to meet me at 9:30 AM but again, he was late, due to unexpected traffic. He eventually arrived at 10 AM and we headed to our first stop, the palace of the wind (Hawa Mahal).</p>
<p>This place is very underwhelming. It looks huge in photos but it actually is a very small building on the side of the road. I didn't go inside since the next destination excited me more, the Amber Fort.&nbsp;<p >As we approached the fort. This place is the highlight of Jaipur for me and I was not disappointed.</p>&nbsp;I rode an elephant up (complimentary by the India by Car company)the fort. To tell you the truth, despite the touters along the way, I felt like a prince of persia returning to my fort. :) It was that epic.</p>

<p>There's something about the design of doors in India that really caught my attention. You can almost always find a unique detail of each doors around India. So mesmerising. The garden inside the fort. Unfortunately, the fort above (up on higher mountain) is a private property and is closed to public.&nbsp;Every corridors are interconnected. It felt like I was Indiana Jones getting lost and finding my way around these ancient rooms. This is the beauty of exploring places without a guide. :)</p>
<p>As I walked through a corridor trying to find my way out, I stumbled upon this little family who decided they wanted me in their pictures so hear I was, randomly appeared in local's camera. :) This is the moment I fell in love with the locals. They are very kind and incredibly friendly. Nothing like I expected before. This really shows how human perception of things are usually bullshit. If you have never experience first hand, don't dismiss it.</p>
<p>After an hour wandering around fort, we drove down (instead of riding an elephant back) the other way and headed to the city palace to learn about this so called Pink City.&nbsp;We stopped at the flooded temple (Jal Mahal) on the way. We decided to go see the Observatory or the Jantar Mantar, the biggest observatory in India. This place consisted off multiple calculation instruments used by the people living here hundred years ago to measure time, days and months.</p>
